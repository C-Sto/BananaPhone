# mkdirectwinsyscall

**warning** This code, and interface is likely to change. If you use it and it works, that's rad, but it might not work and/or break interfaces on the next commit. pls no rely on it (yet) thx.

This is mostly a re-write of go/src/golang.org/x/sys/windows/mkwinsyscall to fit in with bananaphone good.

Todo: write usage/docs/reference etc for this
